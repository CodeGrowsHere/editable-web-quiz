# IMPROVEMENTS

### MISSING FEATURES:
- [custom background] Could add an option to change background color or even different background options. Maybe an option to upload your own. 

### BUGS:
- [Quiz Freeze ]  Sometimes the test will hang after answering a question wrong instead of ending the quiz.

### FEEDBACK:

It's nice but...
The form moves around a lot when entering information.
- [ ] Bug
- [ ] After answering some questions wrong, the next question will not appear until the timer times out
- [ ] The client does not scale correctly to higher res displays (mine is 3k and only about half my screen is filled with content)
